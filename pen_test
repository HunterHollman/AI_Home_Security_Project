Pen Testing

- My Windows firewall is blocking ICMP ping, so normal Nmap scans fail the discovery step.
- My Python HTTP server on port 8000 is running and reachable (curl proved it).
- I use the `-Pn` flag to bypass ping blocks and scan ports directly.

## ✅ Denial-of-Service (DoS) Test

I simulated a Layer 7 HTTP-based DoS attack using Kali Linux to overwhelm my Python web server running on a Windows 10 VM.

### Tools Used:
- `slowloris`
- `hping3`
- `ab` (Apache Benchmark)

### Results:
- Server stopped responding to browser and curl requests.
- Confirmed successful resource exhaustion.
- Helped validate port scanning and load-handling weaknesses.

This demonstrated how easily lightweight HTTP servers can be disrupted — and why detection and rate-limiting are key in any secure network stack.
