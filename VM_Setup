# 🏠 Building My Home Cybersecurity Lab

### By Hunter Hollman

## 🚀 **Project Overview**

I’m building a home cybersecurity lab to:

- Develop hands-on skills in **firewall management** and **penetration testing**
- Create a basic **Security Operations Center (SOC)**
- Simulate **attack and defense scenarios** in a safe, isolated environment

This guide details how I set up two VirtualBox VMs (Kali Linux and Windows 10 Pro), configured networking, and tested connectivity — including the challenges I faced and solutions I found.

## 🖥️ **VM Setup**

| VM Name      | Role              | Network Adapters              | IP Address         |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------|
| Kali Linux   | Attack Machine    | Adapter 1: NAT (Internet)     | 192.168.56.10      |
|              |                   | Adapter 2: Internal Network   |                    |
| Windows 10   | Target Machine    | Adapter 1: NAT (Internet)     | 192.168.56.20      |
|              |                   | Adapter 2: Internal Network   |                    |

**Notes:**

- **Adapter 1 (NAT):** Provides internet access for updates/tools.
- **Adapter 2 (Internal Network named `LAB-NET`):** Isolates VMs for secure interaction.

## ⚙️ **Configuring Static IPs**

### Kali Linux

1. Open terminal and find the internal interface name:
   ```bash
   ip a

Assign IP and activate interface 

sudo ip addr add 192.168.56.10/24 dev eth1
sudo ip link set eth1 up

Windows 10
Right-click → Properties → Select Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) → Properties.

Set static IP:

IP address: 192.168.56.20

Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0

Leave gateway and DNS blank

🧪 Testing Connectivity
Step 1: Ping Test from Kali
bash
Copy
Edit
ping 192.168.56.20
Result:
❌ No reply (0 received) — Windows blocked ICMP Echo Requests by default.

Step 2: Fix Windows Firewall to Allow Ping
Open Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security.

Go to Inbound Rules.

Find File and Printer Sharing (Echo Request - ICMPv4-In).

Right-click and Enable for Private and All Profiles.

After enabling:
✅ Ping replies received — connectivity confirmed.

🔎 Exploring with Nmap
Ran this from Kali to scan Windows:

nmap -sS -sV 192.168.56.20
Discover open ports and services.

Prepare for more advanced penetration testing.
