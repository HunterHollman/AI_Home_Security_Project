# 🏠 Building My Home Cybersecurity Lab and setting up VM's

### By Hunter Hollman

---

##  **Project Overview**



- Develop hands-on skills in **firewall management** and **penetration testing**
- Create a basic **Security Operations Center (SOC)**
- Simulate **attack and defense scenarios** in a safe, isolated environment

This guide details how I set up the two VirtualBox VMs (Kali Linux and Windows 10 Pro), configured networking, and tested connectivity — including the challenges I faced and solutions I found.

## 🖥 **VM Setup**

| VM Name      | Role              | Network Adapters              | IP Address         |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------|
| Kali Linux   | Attack Machine    | Adapter 1: NAT (Internet)     | 192.168.56.10      |
|              |                   | Adapter 2: Internal Network   |                    |
| Windows 10   | Target Machine    | Adapter 1: NAT (Internet)     | 192.168.56.20      |
|              |                   | Adapter 2: Internal Network   |                    |

**Notes:**
I needed isolated networks with different IP's but can communicate and have access to the internet.

- **Adapter 1 (NAT): Provides internet access for updates/tools.
- **Adapter 2 (Internal Network named `LAB-NET`):** Isolates VMs for secure interaction.

## **Configuring Static IPs**

### Kali Linux

1. Opened terminal and found the internal interface name:
   
   ip a

Assign IP and activate interface 

sudo ip addr add 192.168.56.10/24 dev eth1
sudo ip link set eth1 up

Windows 10
Right-click → Properties → Select Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) → Properties.

Set static IP:

IP address: 192.168.56.20

Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0

Left gateway and DNS blank

____________________________________

🧪 Testing Connectivity
Step 1: Ping Test from Kali

ping 192.168.56.20
Result:
❌ No reply (0 received) — Windows blocked ICMP Echo Requests by default.

Step 2: Fix Windows Firewall to Allow Ping
Open Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security.

Go to Inbound Rules.

Find File and Printer Sharing (Echo Request - ICMPv4-In).

Right-click and Enable for Private and All Profiles.

After enabling:
✅ Ping replies received — connectivity confirmed.

 Exploring with Nmap
Ran this from Kali to scan Windows:

nmap -sS -sV 192.168.56.20
Discover open ports and services.

#  Windows VM Port Scanning & Firewall Discovery – Home SOC Lab

After setting up my home cybersecurity lab with a Kali Linux attacker VM and a Windows 10 Pro target VM (both on VirtualBox using an **internal network named `LAB-NET`**), I moved on to scanning the Windows machine for open ports using Nmap.

---

##  Network Setup Recap

- **Kali VM IP:** `192.168.56.10`
- **Windows VM IP:** `192.168.56.20`
- Network type: **Internal Network** (VirtualBox)
- Subnet: `255.255.255.0`
- Gateway/DNS: _Left blank (isolated attack network)_

Both VMs were confirmed to be communicating via ping after adjusting Windows Firewall settings to allow **ICMP Echo Requests**.

##  Initial Nmap Scan

Ran the following from Kali:

```bash
nmap -sS -sV 192.168.56.20
❌ Result: No Open Ports
This meant one (or more) of the following:

🔒 Windows Firewall was blocking all inbound traffic

❌ No services were actively listening on ports

❌ Misconfiguration in the network (but ping worked, so this was ruled out)

🔧 Firewall Troubleshooting
To test the firewall theory, I temporarily disabled the Windows Defender Firewall for the Private Network:

Control Panel → Windows Defender Firewall → Turn Windows Defender Firewall on or off
✅ Turned OFF for Private Network

🔁 Re-Scanning After Firewall Disabled

nmap -sS -sV 192.168.56.20
✅ Result: Open Ports Detected

PORT     STATE SERVICE       VERSION
135/tcp  open  msrpc         Microsoft RPC
139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn   NetBIOS Session Service
445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds  Microsoft Windows SMB
MAC Address: <visible in output>


🧠 What These Ports Mean
Port	Protocol	Description
135	RPC	Used for DCOM and remote service management
139	NetBIOS	Legacy Windows file/print sharing over NetBIOS
445	SMB	Server Message Block — used for file sharing, printer access, and remote admin

These are common ports seen on Windows machines — but also frequently targeted in cyber attacks (ex: WannaCry exploited SMBv1 on port 445).
