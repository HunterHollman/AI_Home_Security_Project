üõ°Ô∏è pfSense Firewall Setup for AI-Powered Home SOC Lab
This guide documents how I set up pfSense as the firewall and router in my AI-driven home cybersecurity lab. The goal is to create a segmented, secure, and monitorable internal network for attack/defense simulations.

üì¶ Environment Overview
Host OS: Windows 11

Hypervisor: VirtualBox

VMs:

pfSense ‚Äî acts as firewall/router

Windows 10 Pro ‚Äî target machine with Python web server

Kali Linux ‚Äî attacker machine

üåê Virtual Network Design
VM	Adapter 1 (WAN)	Adapter 2 (LAN/Internal)
pfSense	NAT	Internal Network (LAB-NET)
Windows 10	NAT	Internal Network (LAB-NET)
Kali Linux	NAT	Internal Network (LAB-NET)

üöÄ Step-by-Step pfSense Setup
1. üîΩ Download pfSense ISO
Visit: https://www.pfsense.org/download/

Choose:

Architecture: AMD64 (64-bit)

Installer: CD Image (ISO) Installer

Mirror: Choose closest

Save the .iso to your local machine

2. üñ•Ô∏è Create pfSense VM in VirtualBox
OS Type: BSD > FreeBSD (64-bit)

RAM: 1‚Äì2GB

Create VHD (20GB+)

Network Settings:
Adapter 1 (WAN):

Attached to: NAT

Adapter 2 (LAN):

Attached to: Internal Network

Name: LAB-NET

3. üíø Boot and Install pfSense
Attach the .iso to the VM's optical drive

Boot the VM and follow the installer

Select default options until prompted for interface setup

4. üîå Network Interface Assignment
Assign em0 to WAN (NAT)

Assign em1 to LAN (Internal Network)

Complete installation, reboot

5. üåê LAN IP Setup
After boot, configure LAN manually:

vbnet

Option 2) Set interface IP
Enter interface to configure: em1
Configure IPv4: y
IP: 192.168.56.1
Subnet: 24 (255.255.255.0)
Gateway: [leave blank]
Enable DHCP: y
DHCP Range: 192.168.56.100 - 192.168.56.200
Enable IPv6: n
 Why This Matters
pfSense will now route all internal traffic, assign IPs, and act as the firewall.

We‚Äôll later:

Add Suricata IDS/IPS

Create VLAN segmentation

Enable logging + ELK stack

Build AI-based traffic analysis tools

 Accessing pfSense Web GUI
From Windows VM (or any internal machine):

Set static IP (e.g. 192.168.56.10, subnet 255.255.255.0, gateway 192.168.56.1)

Open browser:


https://192.168.56.1
Login:

makefile
Copy
Edit
Username: admin
Password: pfsense

Ensure both pfSense and client are on LAB-NET

Ping 192.168.56.1 from Windows


Confirm DHCP is enabled in pfSense LAN config
